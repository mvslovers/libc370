/* Notes about time:
 * In general time values have been represented as the number of seconds
 * since midnight January 1 1970 (epoch). In the earlier years a single 
 * 31 bit (int) or 32 bit (unsigned int) value was used.
 * 
 * More modern "time" implementations are now using 63 bit (long long)
 * or 64 bit (unsigned lonh long) values while keeping the same epoch.
 * 
 * To that extent we have the prototypes listed below in this header 
 * file in support of 64 bit values using the __64 type (see ext/int64.h).
 * 
 * Extensions are also provided for mtime64_t and utime64_t values.
