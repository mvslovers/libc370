Programmers who have available to them 64-bit time values as a 'long
long' type can use localtime64_r() and gmtime64_r() which correctly
converts the time even on 32-bit systems. Whether you have 64-bit time
values will depend on the operating system.
localtime64_r() is a 64-bit equivalent of localtime_r().
gmtime64_r() is a 64-bit equivalent of gmtime_r().
