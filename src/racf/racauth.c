/* RACAUTH.C - racf_auth()
** check authorization to resource
** Hex Code Meaning
** 00       The user is authorized by RACF to obtain use of a RACF-protected
**          resource. Register 0 contains one of the following reason codes:
**      Reason  Meaning
**      00      Indicates a normal completion.
**      04      Indicates STATUS=ERASE was specified and the data set is to
**              be erased when scratched.
**              Otherwise, indicates that the warning status of the resource
**              was requested by the RACHECK issuer setting bit X'10' at
**              offset 12 decimal in the RACHECK parameter list and the
**              resource is in warning mode.
**      10      When CLASS=TAPEVOL, indicates the TAPEVOL profile contains
**              a TVTOC.
**      20      When CLASS=TAPEVOL, indicates that the TAPEVOL profile can
**              contain a TVTOC, but currently does not (for a scratch pool
**              volume).
**      24      When CLASS=TAPEVOL, indicates that the TAPEVOL profile does
**              not contain a TVTOC.
** 04       The specified resource is not protected by RACF. Register 0
**          contains the following reason code:
**      Reason  Meaning
**      00      Indicates a normal completion.
** 08       The user is not authorized by RACF to obtain use of the specified
**          RACF-protected resource. Register 0 contains the following
**          reason code:
**      00      Indicates a normal completion. A possible cause would be
**              PROTECTALL is active, no profile is found, and the user ID
**              whose authority was checked does not have the SPECIAL attribute.
**      04      Indicates STATUS=ERASE was specified and the data set is to
**              be erased when scratched.
**      08      Indicates DSTYPE=T or CLASS=�TAPEVOL� was specified and the
**              user is not authorized to use the specified volume.
**      0C      Indicates the user is not authorized to use the data set.
**      10      Indicates DSTYPE=T or CLASS=�TAPEVOL� was specified and the
**              user is not authorized to specify LABEL=(,BLP).
**      1C      User with EXECUTE authority to the data set profile specified
**              ATTR=READ, and RACF failed the access attempt.
** 0C       The OLDVOL specified was not part of the multivolume data set
**          defined by VOLSER, or it was not part of the same tape volume
**          defined by ENTITY.
** 10       RACINIT issued by third-party RACHECK failed. Register 0 contains
**          the RACINIT return code.
** 64       Indicates that the CHECK subparameter of the RELEASE keyword was
**          specified on the execute form of the RACHECK macro; however, the
**          list form of the macro does not have the proper RELEASE parameter.
**          Macro processing terminates.
